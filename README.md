This project is made in 48H in the suggest of Amazon Web Services.

### The subject was: 
> You will have to develop a fleet management application with three levels of users (the user who can rent/book a vehicle, the community/company that offers vehicles for rent/reservation and the application administrator).

> The user who makes a reservation request must have access to the vehicle information (mileage, technical data, availability dates...).

> The community/company manages the update of its fleet with the possibility of adding new vehicles or removing some. It must also manage the maintenance part and therefore be able to make a vehicle temporarily unavailable.
